difference between is null and euqla:=
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9581745/sql-is-null-and-null
The reasoning is that a null means "unknown", so the result of any comparison to a null is also "unknown".
So you'll get no hit on rows by coding where my_column = null.

SQL provides the special syntax for testing if a column is null, 
via is null and is not null, which is a special condition to test for a null (or not a null).
